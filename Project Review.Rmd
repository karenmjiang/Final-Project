# Final Project Milestone 2

Here we will review two projects from last year, and discusss some of the pros and cons in their projects. I selected the projects based on my personal interest, especially their relation to public health policy.


### [Medicare Share Savings Program](https://andres-deloera.shinyapps.io/ACO_Exploration/) 
#### by Andres de Loera-Brust

This project represents the example that did not need to do extensive data cleaning. Data was acquired from CMS website.

| Pros      | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Variable definition were helpful to understand a technical dataset such as this one | Under Program Features tab, the default diagram is a scatter plot. However the X and Y variables are not all continuous, which creates some rather un-intuitive plots |
| This project is very well suited for exploratory data analysis. | While the interactive nature of the shiny app is helpful, I think it would benefit to have some of the graphs display at the same time to aid with comparisons|

### [Visualization of effects of Medicaid Expansion on Immunization Rates](https://rqiu.shinyapps.io/Vaccine-Explorer/) 
#### by Richard Qiu


| Pros  | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Animate factors was a clever way to show trends over time | Correlation =/= Causation, in terms of ACA increasing immunization rates |
| Data gathering was well thought through, display / navigation was intuitive and easy to use. | Honestly, it was great job all around! |
